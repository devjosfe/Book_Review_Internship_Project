## 1. Introduction

BookReviewFun is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, with PostgreSQL as the relational database and Prisma as the ORM. This platform allows users to explore a collection of books, register, sign in, add new books (admin-only), write reviews, and manage their personal read lists. It emphasizes robust authentication, efficient data management, and a user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates proficiency in developing scalable and maintainable web applications, adhering to modern development practices.

## 2. Features

The application provides the following core functionalities:

- **User Authentication:**
  - Secure user registration with password hashing (bcryptjs).
  - User sign-in and sign-out functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management.
  - Protected routes ensuring only authenticated users can access certain features.
  - Role-based access control (Admin/User) to manage book creation.
- **Book Management:**
  - View a comprehensive list of all available books with pagination for efficient Browse.
  - Detailed view for each book, including its description, author, release year, and cover image.
  - **Admin-only:** Functionality to add new books to the platform, including uploading cover images.
- **Review System:**
  - Users can submit reviews (ratings and comments) for any book.
  - View all reviews associated with a specific book.
- **Read List:**
  - Users can add books to and remove books from their personal read list.
- **Pagination:**
  - Efficiently retrieves and displays large datasets of books, improving performance and user experience.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface across various devices.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Integrated `react-toastify` for clear and timely user notifications (success, error messages).

## 3. Technologies Used

This project leverages a powerful combination of technologies:

**Backend:**

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL:** Robust, open-source relational database system.
- **Prisma ORM:** Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, providing type-safe database access and powerful migrations.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken):** For creating and verifying authentication tokens.
- **bcryptjs:** For secure password hashing.
- **Multer:** Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for file uploads (book cover images).
- **dotenv:** For managing environment variables securely.
- **express-async-handler:** Utility for simplifying error handling in asynchronous Express middleware.

**Frontend:**

- **React.js:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM:** For declarative routing in React applications.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **React Toastify:** For elegant and customizable toast notifications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

### ⭐ **Highlight: Strategic Use of TypeScript**

While the MERN stack typically implies JavaScript, this project was developed using **TypeScript** for both the backend (Node.js/Express/Prisma) and the frontend (React). This decision was made proactively to enhance the development process and the robustness of the application by:

- **Improved Code Quality:** Catching type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime, leading to fewer bugs in production.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** Providing clear type definitions makes the codebase easier to understand, refactor, and extend, especially in larger teams or for future development.
- **Better Developer Experience:** Leveraging IDE features like auto-completion, intelligent refactoring, and inline documentation for a more efficient and less error-prone coding experience.
- **Scalability:** TypeScript's strong typing is invaluable for complex applications, ensuring data consistency across different layers (frontend, backend, database schema via Prisma).

This choice demonstrates an understanding of modern software engineering principles and a commitment to building high-quality, maintainable applications.

## 4. Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the BookReviewFun project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (v8 or higher recommended)
- PostgreSQL database server (running locally or accessible via a cloud provider like Neon.tech)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository and run the project

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd bookReviewFun # Or whatever your project's root folder is named



cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev


# open second terminal
cd backend
npm i
npm run dev

# remember to add .env file in both frontend and backend

# a frontend .env file will provided keep in the root frontend folder

# similiar a backend .env file will be provided keep it in backend .env folder
```
